The [Dumeaux lab](https://lab-dumeaux.science/) is capable of executing projects from the statistical design phase, through high-throughput profiling, to downstream analysis that transforms data into knowledge and translationnal applications. Our research aims at identifying associations between genomic elements (characterized by genome-scale assays) and human normal physiology, disease incidence or prognosis. Our lab is motivated by studying disease within the context of the individual in order to create a more holistic understanding of these states. Our focus is towards characterizing two main systems, the immune response and gut microbiome, and their interplay with one's lifestyle and exposure to elucidate their involvement in human normal physiology and disease. Using this information, we will hopefully suggest new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases.
