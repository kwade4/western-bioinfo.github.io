At the [Dumeaux lab](https://lab-dumeaux.science/), we specialize in taking projects from statistical design to high-throughput profiling and in-depth downstream analysis. Our primary objective is to uncover associations between genomic elements, as identified by genome-scale assays, and aspects of human health, including normal physiology, disease onset, and prognosis. Committed to understanding diseases within the context of the individual, we foster a comprehensive view of health states. We investigate the intricate roles of two essential systems: the immune response and the gut microbiome.  Analyzing their interactions with an individual's lifestyle and external exposures helps us elucidate their individual and combined influences on human health and disease. With this knowledge in hand, we aim to propose new strategies for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
