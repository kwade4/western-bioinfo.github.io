# Abstract

Several disease risk variants reside on non-coding regions of DNA, particularly in open chromatin regions of specific cell types. Identifying the cell types relevant to complex traits through the integration of chromatin accessibility data and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data can help to elucidate the mechanisms of these traits. In this study, we created a collection of associations between the combinations of chromatin accessibility data (bulk and single-cell) with an array of 201 complex phenotypes. We integrated the GWAS data of these 201 phenotypes with bulk chromatin accessibility data from 137 cell types measured by DNase-I hypersensitive sequencing and found significant results (FDR adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) for at least one cell type in 21 complex phenotypes, such as atopic dermatitis, Graves' disease, and body mass index. With the integration of single-cell chromatin accessibility data measured by an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq), taken from 111 adult and 111 fetal cell types, the resolution of association was magnified, enabling the identification of further cell types. This resulted in the identification of significant correlations (FDR adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) between 15 categories of single-cell subtypes and 59 phenotypes ranging from autoimmune diseases like Graves' disease to cardiovascular traits like diastolic/systolic blood pressure.
